## 1. Ideal Storage chocolate Conditions:
Temperature:  Keep between 15°C and 20°C (59–68°F).
Humidity: Less than 50%. Moisture can make chocolate sticky or grainy.
Light: Store away from direct sunlight — it fades color and affects flavor.
Air: Keep it in a sealed container  (chocolate absorbs odors easily)
